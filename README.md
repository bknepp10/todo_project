**ToDo Project**

A simple todo app built with Vite/React/TypeScript. I wanted to do this project in order to brush up on my skills in react. I also decided to try something new and styled the project completely using Bootstrap 5. 

**To run:**
  1. clone repo
  2. cd `<project_path>` 
  3. npm install
  4. npm run dev
